Hello, I am Yuqi Tu, a rising senior majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at UW-Madison. Before coming to Madison, I spent two years at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. I am very interested in high-dimensional statistics, and I am very honored to be mentored by Prof. Benedek Valko, Ilias Diakonikolas, and Joshua Cape.
